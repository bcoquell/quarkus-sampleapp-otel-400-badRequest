Please find sample app in compressed file :
apm-imperative.zip
Sampleapp quarkus (classical imperative libs)

quarkus-app.zip

Unzip it

Launch app -> 
In quarkus-app folder
java -jar quarkus-run.jar (java 17 in our case)

Application is listening on port 8080 and API is /v1/profileData
It will always send an HTTP 400 response but :
- if no header get_400 is set so the 400 will be generated outside of the controller
- if a header get_400 is set with for example true value so the 400 will be generated inside the controller

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/profileData/ 
curl  curl -H "<header>" -H 'get_400: true'

Please see PDF to find our screenshots / observations (open telemetry agent 1.27 -> elastic apm server as collector)

The main difference is that transaction.name and transaction.name.text are "GET /" in case of 400 generated outside the controller and "GET /v1/profileData" inside it.
url.* fields have same values

Thanks for your help.
